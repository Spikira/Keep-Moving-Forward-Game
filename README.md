# Keep-Moving-Forward-Game

The first game I've ever completed, Keep Moving Forward! 
It's a topdown shooter where you play as a tank that can only move forward and strafe. 
It was cobbled together in a month as a break from my main project. 
It's definitely not the easiest game and could be improved, but as a game completed in one month I think it's pretty good.
